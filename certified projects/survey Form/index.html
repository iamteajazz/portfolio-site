  <!-- Build a Survey Form
  Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks
  
  User Stories:
  
  You should have a page title in an h1 element with an id of title
  You should have a short explanation in a p element with an id of description
  You should have a form element with an id of survey-form
  Inside the form element, you are required to enter your name in an input field that has an id of name and a type of text
  Inside the form element, you are required to enter your email in an input field that has an id of email
  If you enter an email that is not formatted correctly, you will see an HTML5 validation error
  Inside the form, you can enter a number in an input field that has an id of number
  The number input should not accept non-numbers, either by preventing you from typing them or by showing an HTML5 validation error (depending on your browser).
  If you enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, you will see an HTML5 validation error
  For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see corresponding label elements in the form, that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label"
  For the name, email, and number input fields, you can see placeholder text that gives a description or instructions for each field
  Inside the form element, you should have a select dropdown element with an id of dropdown and at least two options to choose from
  Inside the form element, you can select an option from a group of at least two radio buttons that are grouped using the name attribute
  Inside the form element, you can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute
  Inside the form element, you are presented with a textarea for additional comments
  Inside the form element, you are presented with a button with id of submit to submit all the inputs
  Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!
